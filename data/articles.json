With roughly 200,000 H100/H200s and ~30,000 GB200 NVL72, it remains, today, the largest fully operational, single-coherent cluster (setting apart Google, master of multi-datacenter-training).

AWS is the crown jewel of the Amazon empire, generating ~60% of group profits, and dominating the lucrative Cloud Computing market. But it struggles to translate this strength into the new GPU/XPU Cloud era. Microsoft Azure now leads the market on quarterly new cloud revenue, and the gap between Google Cloud and AWS has materially narrowed especially with Google&#8217;s big moves on the TPU tha",
